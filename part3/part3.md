1. The bug was that both num1 and num2 were strings, which meant that the addition that was taking place in the calculateSum function was adding two strings instead of two numbers.

2. You can fix this issue by parsing both num1 and num2 from their original types of string to int. This will mean the result variable is a result of integer addition instead of string addition, and will now return the correct sum.
